# Linux Container
- Docker project provides the means of packaging applications in lightweight Linux containers
- A container is a system process hiding themself from other processes/containers on the same machine.
- Docker uses standard Linux kernel features to do this.
- Containers existed in Linux/Unix before anyone cared of them, Docker just made using them easier and mass adoption followed.
