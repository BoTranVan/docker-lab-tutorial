# Linux Containers

- Docker project provides the means of packaging applications in lightweight Linux containers

- A container is a system process hiding themself from other processes/containers on the same machine.

- Docker uses standard Linux kernel features to do this.

- Containers existed in Linux/Unix before anyone cared of them, Docker just made using them easier and mass adoption followed.

## Linux Containers pillars

- ***chroot:*** first form of container. A technique in Linux and Unix systems that changes the root directory of a process and all its children. A program that is run in such environment cannot access files and commands outside the chroot directory tree. This modified environment is also called a *jail*.

- ***cgroups:***  an abbreviation for control groups. It is a Linux kernel feature that limits and isolates the resource usage like CPU, memory, disk I/O, network, etc. of a collection of processes.

- ***namespaces:*** a technique to allow sandboxing of resources like processes, networks, users, mounts, and others. Multiple manespaces can be set on the same Linux machine providing a complete isolation of these resources.
